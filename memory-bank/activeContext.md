# Active Context - Bluprint Graphics Kit

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Task: Marmaray Story Development

The main focus is on developing and refining the Marmaray story (`pages/marmaray/+page.svelte`), which is an interactive data story about suicide incidents on Istanbul's Marmaray metro system.

### Recent Changes Made

1. **Content Warning Alignment**: Fixed left alignment for the content warning in Step 0
2. **Title Alignment**: Added CSS rules to force SiteHeadline component to be left-aligned
3. **Component Structure**: Maintained proper container-component relationships

### Current State

- **Story Structure**: Complete with scroll-driven narrative
- **Visual Components**: Interactive maps, charts, and 3D models integrated
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach implemented
- **Content**: Turkish language content about Marmaray incidents

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Decisions

1. **Left Alignment**: All text content should be left-aligned for better readability
2. **Content Warning**: Prominently displayed at the beginning of the story
3. **Scroll-Driven Narrative**: Each step triggers visual state changes
4. **Mobile Responsive**: All components stack properly on mobile devices

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**: Ensuring smooth scroll interactions and fast loading
2. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and screen reader support
3. **Cross-Browser**: Testing across different browsers and devices
4. **Data Visualization**: Optimizing chart and map performance

### Content Considerations

1. **Sensitive Topic**: Suicide prevention content with appropriate warnings
2. **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring all statistics and data are correct
3. **Language**: Turkish content with proper grammar and style
4. **User Experience**: Clear navigation and intuitive interactions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Test Current Changes**: Verify that title and content warning alignments are working correctly
2. **Performance Optimization**: Check for any performance issues with current implementation
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test the story across different browsers and devices
4. **Accessibility Review**: Ensure all components meet accessibility standards

### Short-term Goals

1. **Story Refinement**: Polish the narrative flow and visual transitions
2. **Data Updates**: Ensure all data is current and accurate
3. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on user experience and story flow
4. **Documentation**: Update development guide with learnings from this story

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Component Library**: Extract reusable components from this story
2. **Template Creation**: Create story templates for similar data-driven narratives
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement analytics to track story performance
4. **Publishing Pipeline**: Prepare story for Reuters publishing workflow
