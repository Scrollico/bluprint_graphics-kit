This is the third step of my first attempt to learn canvas. I want to improve a piece a made a few weeks ago about the division of [occupations](http://nbremer.github.io/occupations/). The D3.js version has so many DOM elements due to all the small bar charts that it is very slow. Therefore, I hope that a canvas version might improve things

To not stray too far from D3.js I used the excellent tutorials on canvas and d3 from Irene Ros & Yannick Assogba which you can find [here](https://bocoup.com/weblog/d3js-and-canvas) and [here](https://bocoup.com/weblog/2d-picking-in-canvas). I managed to get the circle packing working. However, when you zoom it is very jittery.

I wrote a more extensive tutorial around what I learned while doing this project in my blog [Learnings from a D3.js addict on starting with Canvas](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/11/learnings-from-a-d3-js-addict-on-starting-with-canvas.html) in which this can be seen as step 3. See the previous, [non-zoomable version here](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/5a801d9153059b226bbd) and the next better working [zoomable version here](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/db24422abdb20150a9dd). In the next version the d3 components have been downsized and the jitter is almost gone
