## Graphics components

The `@reuters-graphics/graphics-components` library includes pre-styled components for easily adding graphics or other elements to a page.

### Adding new components to a page

Components from the `@reuters-graphics/graphics-components` library are often added to the `#each` loop in `src/lib/App.svelte` that loops over `content.blocks`.

`content` represents text content pulled from our CMS as JSON that is passed into components via props.

Each block in `content.blocks` (i.e., "content block") is usually an object with a `type` property and additional properties specific to the block type. For example:

- **Text Block**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "This is a text block."
  }
  ```
- **AI Graphic Block**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "ai-graphic",
    "chart": "AiMap",
    "width": "normal",
    "textWidth": "normal",
    "title": "Optional title of the graphic",
    "description": "Optional chatter describes more about the graphic.",
    "notes": "Note: Optional note clarifying something in the data.\r\n\r\nSource: Optional source of the data.",
    "altText": "Add a description of the graphic for screen readers. This is invisible on the page."
  }
  ```

To add a new component to the loop:

1. Import the component in the script portion of the Svelte component.
2. Add a new `else if` condition in the `{#each content.blocks as block}` loop to handle the new block type.
3. Pass the required props to the component, ensuring they match the structure of the content block object.

For example, to add a new FeaturePhoto:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  // ...

  import { assets } from '$app/paths';

  import {
    Article,
    Analytics,
    BodyText,
    EndNotes,
    SiteHeadline,
    GraphicBlock,
    InlineAd,
    FeautePhoto, // Add the component to others already imported
  } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-components';

  // ...
</script>

{#each content.blocks as block}
  <!-- Text block -->
  {#if block.type === 'text'}
    <BodyText text={block.text} />

    <!-- Other block types -->

    <!-- Add new FeaturePhoto block -->
  {:else if block.type === 'feature-photo'}
    <FeaturePhoto
      src="{assets}/{block.src}"
      alt={block.alt}
      caption={block.caption}
      credit={block.credit}
    />
  {:else}
    <LogBlock message={`Unknown block type: "${block.type}"`} />
  {/if}
{/each}
```

### Paths to multimedia files

Notice in the example above, we append the `assets` variable from SvelteKit's `$app/paths` module to the `src` path we got from the content block.

Always assume that paths to local multimedia files including images and videos specified in content blocks are relative and must be prefixed with the `assets` variable to make them absolute. For example:

```svelte
<FeaturePhoto
  src="{assets}/{block.src}"
  alt={block.alt}
  caption={block.caption}
  credit={block.credit}
/>
```

### Adding AI Graphics

AI (i.e., Adobe Illustrator) graphics are added to the page by importing a component from the `src/lib/ai2svelte/` directory and then adding that graphic to the `aiCharts` object in `src/lib/App.svelte`. Then the object key for that chart is included in the content block's `chart` property.

For example, to use an AI graphic from `src/lib/ai2svelte/map.svelte`:

- The AI graphic component is imported and added to the `aiCharts` object in `src/lib/App.svelte`:

  ```svelte
  <script lang="ts">
    // ...
    import Map from './ai2svelte/map.svelte';

    // ...

    const aiCharts = {
      // Other AI graphics ...
      Map, // Added to the object
    };
  </script>
  ```

- Now the content block will specify the key to the chart in `aiCharts` in the `chart` property:

  ```json
  {
    "type": "ai-graphic",
    "chart": "Map",
    "width": "normal",
    "textWidth": "normal",
    "title": "My map",
    "description": "A map of the area",
    "notes": "Source: DataSource.org",
    "altText": "A map of a specific area showing something interesting"
  }
  ```

- Now the `{:else if block.type === 'ai-graphic'}` block in `src/lib/App.svelte` uses that key to get the component:

  ```svelte
  {#each content.blocks as block}
    <!-- Text block -->
    {#if block.type === 'text'}
      <BodyText text={block.text} />

      <!-- Ai2svelte graphic block -->
    {:else if block.type === 'ai-graphic'}
      {#if !aiCharts[block.chart]}
        <LogBlock message={`Unable to find "${block.chart}" in aiCharts`} />
      {:else}
        {@const AiChart = aiCharts[block.chart]}
        <GraphicBlock
          id={block.chart}
          width={containerWidth(block.width)}
          title={block.title}
          description={block.description}
          notes={block.notes}
          ariaDescription={block.altText}
        >
          <AiChart assetsPath={assets || '/'} />
        </GraphicBlock>
      {/if}

      <!-- Other block types -->
    {/if}
  {/each}
  ```

### Refer to graphics components Storybook

If you're unsure how to implement a particular graphics component, suggest the user check the Storybook documentation site, which is hosted on GitHub at https://reuters-graphics.github.io/graphics-components/.

### Writing content blocks in our CMS

While the text content in the `content` object is formatted as JSON, that data is written into our CMS (which is called "RNGS.io") using ArchieML syntax.

**When suggesting what content blocks to add for components, please also suggest how to write that content in our CMS (RNGS.io) using ArchieML.**

#### ArchieML

ArchieML is a lightweight and intuitive markup language that allows for easy structuring of data within text documents. It is designed to be human-readable, very flexible, and is particularly useful for creating structured data by users who may never have seen ArchieML or any other markup language before.

##### Basic Syntax

- **Keys and Values**

  - Definition: Key-value pairs are defined by a line starting with a key followed by a colon. Keys can include any unicode character except whitespace and specific characters used within ArchieML ({ } [ ] : . +).

  - Example:

    ```
    key: This is a value
    ☃: Unicode Snowman for you and you and you!
    ```

  - Parsed JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "key": "This is a value",
      "☃": "Unicode Snowman for you and you and you!"
    }
    ```

  - Whitespace around keys and values is ignored. Keys are case-sensitive.

- **Multi-line Values**: Multi-line values are anchored with `:end`. All whitespace is preserved.

  - Example:

    ```
    key: value
    More value

    Even more value
    :end
    ```

  - Parsed JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "key": "value\n More value\n\nEven more value"
    }
    ```
  - Escape Characters: Lines that would be interpreted as keys or commands can be escaped with a backslash `\`.
    - Example:
      ```
      key: value
      \:end
      :end
      ```
    - Parsed JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "key": "value\n:end"
      }
      ```

- **Nested Structures**

  - **Dot-Notation**: Use dot-notation for creating nested objects.
    - Example:
      ```
      colors.red: #f00
      colors.green: #0f0
      colors.blue: #00f
      ```
    - Parsed JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "colors": {
          "red": "#f00",
          "green": "#0f0",
          "blue": "#00f"
        }
      }
      ```
  - **Object Blocks**: Group keys using object blocks defined by {}. Close an object with {} or by starting a new object.

    - Example:

      ```
      {colors}
      red: #f00
      green: #0f0
      blue: #00f
      {}

      {numbers}
      one: 1
      ten: 10
      one-hundred: 100
      {}
      ```

    - Parsed JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "colors": {
          "red": "#f00",
          "green": "#0f0",
          "blue": "#00f"
        },
        "numbers": {
          "one": "1",
          "ten": "10",
          "one-hundred": "100"
        }
      }
      ```

- **Arrays**

  - **Arrays of Objects**: Define arrays with brackets [arrayName]. New objects start when the first key is re-encountered.

    - Example:

      ```
      [arrayName]
      name: Amanda
      age: 26

      name: Tessa
      age: 30
      []
      ```

    - Parsed JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "arrayName": [
          {
            "name": "Amanda",
            "age": "26"
          },
          {
            "name": "Tessa",
            "age": "30"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

  - **Arrays of Strings**: Simple arrays use _ for elements. If _ is first, the array ignores key-value pairs.
    - Example:
      ```
      [days]
      * Sunday
      * Monday
      * Tuesday
      * Wednesday
      * Thursday
      * Friday
      * Saturday
      []
      ```
    - Parsed JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "days": [
          "Sunday",
          "Monday",
          "Tuesday",
          "Wednesday",
          "Thursday",
          "Friday",
          "Saturday"
        ]
      }
      ```
  - **Nested Arrays**: Nested arrays use dot notation and are closed with `[]`.

    - Example:

      ```
      [days]
      name: Monday
      [.tasks]
      * Clean dishes
      * Pick up room
      []

      name: Tuesday
      [.tasks]
      * Buy milk
      []
      ```

    - Parsed JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "days": [
          {
            "name": "Monday",
            "tasks": ["Clean dishes", "Pick up room"]
          },
          {
            "name": "Tuesday",
            "tasks": ["Buy milk"]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

#### ArchieML conventions in our CMS

Usually, content blocks are written in our CMS as objects inside an ArchieML array called `blocks` and always start with a `type:` key/value pair that defines the type of the content block object.

For example, a user adding a content block for a FeaturePhoto component, might add the following to the existing `[blocks]` array in our CMS:

```
[blocks]

type: feature-photo
src: images/myPhoto.jpg
alt: Alt text for my photo...

... which extends over multiple lines.
:end
caption: A photo of something interesting.
