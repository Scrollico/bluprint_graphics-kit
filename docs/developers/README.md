# Graphics developer docs

These docs describe how to use the [Reuters graphics kit](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit) to build graphics pages and embeddables. They're designed for Reuters Graphics editors, but can also be used by clients who would like to customize projects built with the graphics kit.
