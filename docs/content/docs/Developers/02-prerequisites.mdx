## Code editor

We strongly recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit project code.

## Node

The graphics kit requires a minimum version of Node, which will be specified in the `engines` key of `package.json`. We highly recommend using a Node version manager so you can easily switch which version of node you want to use.

[n](https://github.com/tj/n) is a great option and can be installed easily on MacOS using brew:

```console
brew install n
```

Once installed, you can use it to download and install any version of node:

```console
n use 22
```

## Svelte

The graphics kit uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and you'll want to understand a few basics before diving in.

Check out the first few sections of the [official tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte) for an intro to the framework.

## SvelteKit / Vite

The graphics kit uses [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction), which in turn uses a build tool called [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html).
