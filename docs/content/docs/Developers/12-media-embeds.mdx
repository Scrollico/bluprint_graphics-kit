You can package static files -- e.g., JPG and EPS assets -- for clients in the `media-assets/` directory.

Assets must be structured using the same directory scheme as embed pages -- a folder for a valid locale and for a unique slug within the locale. The JPG and EPS filenames can be whatever you want them to be.

<FileTree>
- media-assets
  - en
    - chart
      - chart.eps
      - chart.jpg
    - map
      - my-map.eps
      - map-preview.jpg
</FileTree>

If you have an [embeddable page](https://reuters-graphics.github.io/docs_graphics-kit/for_developers/pages) using the same locale/slug scheme as a set of flat assets, the publisher will upload the JPG and EPS file with the embeddable version of the same graphic.
