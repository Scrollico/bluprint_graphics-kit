import { FileTree } from  '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When you're ready to publish the project, change the `homepage` prop in `package.json` to the URL where you'd like to host the files.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "homepage": "https://your-site.com/this-project/"
}
```

Then run the `build` script in your terminal:

```console
npm run build
```

The files you'll need to host on your server will be built in the `dist` directory of the project. They'll look something like this:

<FileTree>

- dist
  - cdn
    - ... JS, CSS, images, etc.
  - embeds
    - ... Embeddable pages
  - index.html
  

</FileTree>

You're now ready to upload the project to your server. Be sure to upload _all_ the files in the `dist` directory to the location on your server you specified in `homepage` in `package.json`.
