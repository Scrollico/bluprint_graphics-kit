import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When you're ready to publish the project, change the `homepage` prop in `package.json` to the URL where you'd like to host the files.

```javascript
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "homepage": "https://your-site.com/this-project/"
}
```

Then run the `build` script in your terminal:

```console
npm run build
```

The files you'll need to host on your server will be built in the `dist` directory of the project. They'll look something like this:

<FileTree>

- dist
  - cdn
    - ... JS, CSS, images, etc.
  - embeds
    - ... Embeddable pages
  - index.html

</FileTree>

You're now ready to upload the project to your server. Be sure to upload _all_ the files in the `dist` directory to the location on your server you specified in `homepage` in `package.json`.

## Self-hosting embeddable graphics

After building the project and uploading it to your servers, you can add _embeddable graphics_ to your pages using the following embed code template by updating the URL to the embeddable graphic hosted on your servers.

```html "https://your-site.com/this-project/embeds/en/map/"
<script>
  var pymParent = new pym.Parent(
    'my-graphic',
    'https://your-site.com/this-project/embeds/en/map/',
    {}
  );
</script>
<div id="my-graphic'"></div>
```

Be sure to also include the pym.js dependency script **at most once** on each page where you will embed graphics.

```html
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/cdn/pym.v1.min.js"
></script>
```

You can also self-host the above pym.js script on your own servers, if you'd prefer.
