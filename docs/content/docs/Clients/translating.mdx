Most text content for pages is located in JSON files in the `locales/` directory of the project. Translating the text in `locales/en/content.json`, for example, and then rebuilding the project (see Building for self-hosting, below) will replace the text on the page in whatever language you choose.

For example, you could translate the below text in English...

```json
// locales/en/content.json
{
  "greeting": "Hello!"
}
```

... into German, being sure **not** to translate the _keys_ in the JSON, just the values.

```json
// locales/en/content.json
{
  "greeting": "Servus!"
}
```

Some text content for things like annotations on individual charts may be located in components that live in the `src/lib/` directory. You can also edit this text within the code and rebuild the project to replace the text with your translation.
