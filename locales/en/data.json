New cases were reaching new records in Europe, where the World Health Organization has warned of a worrying spread just weeks away from the winter influenza season. The WHO has also warned the pandemic still needs major control interventions amid rising case numbers in Latin America, where many countries have started to resume normal social and public life. \n\nGlobally, data from a Reuters tally shows how the share of deaths by region has shifted over time, from Asia to the Middle East, Europe and North America, and then to Latin America."},{"Type":"text","Value":"\n### The victims\n\nThe high number of deaths has led to changes to traditional and religious burial rites around the world, with morgues and funeral businesses overwhelmed and loved ones often barred from bidding farewell in person.\n\nIn Israel, the custom of washing the bodies of Muslim deceased is not permitted, and instead of being shrouded in cloth, they must be wrapped in a plastic body bag. The Jewish tradition of Shiva where people go to the home of mourning relatives for seven days has also been disrupted. \n\nIn Italy, Catholics have been buried without funerals or a blessing from a priest, while in Iraq former militiamen dropped their guns to dig graves at a specially-created cemetery, learning how to conduct Christian, as well as Muslim, burials.\n\nOn the Indonesian islands of Java, Sulawesi and Bali, bereaved families have barged into hospitals to claim bodies of COVID-19 victims, fearing their relatives might not be given a burial in line with religious beliefs. Dozens were subsequently infected. \n\nAn indigenous group in the Ecuadorean Amazon took two police officers and a state official hostage to successfully demand authorities return the body of a community leader who authorities said died of COVID-19 for a traditional burial. \n\nThe United States, Indonesia, Bolivia, South Africa and Yemen have all been forced to work overtime to dig new graves and locate new burial sites as cemeteries fill up."},{"Type":"text","Value":"\n### Elderly at risk\n\nPublic health experts are looking at how demographics affect the death rates in different regions. Some European countries with older populations have reported higher fatality rates, for instance.\n\n\nAn April report by the EU Centers for Disease Control looked at over 300,000 cases in 20 countries and found that about 46% of all fatalities were over the age of 80.  \n\n\nIn Indonesia, hundreds of children are believed to have died, a development health officials have attributed to malnutrition, anemia and inadequate child health facilities. \n\n\nHealth experts caution that the official data likely does not tell the full story, with many believing that both cases and deaths have likely been underreported in some countries."}]}
