This directory is a place to keep working files that don't need to be published with your project.

That includes things like Adobe Illustrator templates or large media files.

By default, anything in this directory WILL NOT be packaged to clients who want to customize your code.

Also by default, anything in this directory WILL BE committed to GitHub so you can share these working files with others on the team.

If you need to exclude a file in this directory, then add it to the .gitignore at the root of the project. For example:

```bash
project-files/my-super-large-video.mp4
```
