ðŸ¤– Svelte 5 alive! Svelte 5 is now enabled inside the Graphics Kit.

## Migration steps

The minimum version of Node is now `>20.18`.

Check out Svelte's [official migration guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide) to read up on Svelte 5's overhauled syntax and new reactivity system with [Runes](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/what-are-runes).

Not ready to make the leap? Don't worry! You can continue to write components in Svelte 4 / "Legacy" syntax with no problems. You'll just get faster pages with no change to your code. You can even mix and match components using the new syntax with components using the old and vice versa.
