This kit is **now ready for active use**, and we are starting the process of sunsetting the [current, Webpack-based rig](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-rig).

That said, there may still be issues as [SvelteKit continues to work towards a 1.0 release](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/CHANGELOG.md) and as we continue to develop the boilerplate projects start from.

**If this is your first time using this kit**, please build in a little extra time around your deadline in case you need any help when building, uploading and publishing your project.
