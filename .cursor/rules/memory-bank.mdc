# Memory Bank

The Memory Bank is a critical component of this project, serving as the comprehensive documentation system that maintains project context across sessions.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank exists because our memory resets completely between sessions. After each reset, we rely ENTIRELY on the Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively.

## Structure

The Memory Bank follows a hierarchical structure:

```
projectbrief.md → productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md → activeContext.md → progress.md
```

## Core Files

- [projectbrief.md](mdc:memory-bank/projectbrief.md) - Foundation document that shapes all other files
- [productContext.md](mdc:memory-bank/productContext.md) - Why this project exists and user goals
- [systemPatterns.md](mdc:memory-bank/systemPatterns.md) - System architecture and design patterns
- [techContext.md](mdc:memory-bank/techContext.md) - Technologies and technical constraints
- [activeContext.md](mdc:memory-bank/activeContext.md) - Current work focus and next steps
- [progress.md](mdc:memory-bank/progress.md) - Project status and achievements

## Usage Guidelines

1. Read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional
2. Update the Memory Bank whenever:
   - Discovering new project patterns
   - After implementing significant changes
   - When context needs clarification
3. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state
4. Create additional files when needed for complex features or specialized documentation
