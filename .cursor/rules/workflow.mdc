# Workflow Processes

This project follows specific workflows for planning and execution.

## Plan Mode

When entering "Planner Mode" or using the /plan command:

1. Deeply reflect on requested changes
2. Analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes
3. Ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on findings
4. Draft a comprehensive action plan
5. Get approval before implementation
6. Implement all steps in the approved plan
7. Report progress after completing each phase/step

## Act Mode

For executing tasks:

1. Check Memory Bank files for context
2. Update documentation as necessary
3. Update .cursorrules if needed
4. Execute the task
5. Document changes

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates should occur when:

1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** 
4. When context needs clarification

## Project Intelligence

The [.cursorrules](mdc:.cursorrules) file captures project-specific patterns, preferences, and intelligence:

- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow patterns
- Project-specific conventions
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

This document grows smarter as work progresses, enhancing effectiveness with the project.
