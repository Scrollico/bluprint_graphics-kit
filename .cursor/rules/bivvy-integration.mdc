# Bivvy Integration

This project uses Bivvy for managing features, bugs, tasks, and explorations.

## Bivvy Workflow

Bivvy provides a structured approach for:

1. **Creating** new pitches for features, bugs, tasks, or explorations
2. **Working on** active pitches with proper tracking
3. **Closing** completed pitches with appropriate documentation

## Usage Guidelines

When working with Bivvy:

1. Ensure proper categorization of work items (feature, bug, task, exploration)
2. Document progress in the Memory Bank, particularly in activeContext.md
3. Update progress.md when significant milestones are reached
4. Reference Bivvy pitches in commit messages and documentation for traceability

## Integration with Memory Bank

When working on a Bivvy pitch:

1. Document the pitch details in activeContext.md
2. Track progress in progress.md
3. Update relevant technical documentation in systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
4. Once completed, move from activeContext.md to a record of completion in progress.md
